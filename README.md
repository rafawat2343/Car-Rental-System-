# Car-Rental-System-
This project is about how we can manage the car booking to customer, how we can take registration of car for rent from Car owner. We can also add staff for taking care of the car that has been registered to their ID. Using this software, any customer can choose an available car to rent from a car rental shop.
For running the software, find the file named 'LoginGUI' through src>GUI>LoginGUI.java. Then run this file in eclipse IDE.
